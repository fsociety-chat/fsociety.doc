# F-Society's Lan-Chat
### F-Society's Lan-Chat project is a communication tool designed for local area networks (LANs) that allows users to exchange messages and files within the same network. It was created with the goal of providing a secure and easy-to-use platform for users to communicate with one another without the need for internet access or third-party applications.

## Features:

* Instant messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly within the same LAN network.
* File sharing: Users can share files with one another easily and securely, without having to rely on external storage solutions.
* User authentication: Only authorized users within the same network can access the Lan-Chat system.
* Encryption: All messages and files are encrypted to ensure privacy and security.
* Customizable settings: Users can customize their preferences and settings to fit their needs and preferences.

## Technical details:

* The Lan-Chat system is built using the Python programming language.
* It uses socket programming to establish connections between users within the same LAN network.
* The system utilizes asymmetric encryption techniques to secure messages and files.
* User authentication is done through a password-based system.
* The system is designed to be lightweight and can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

## Future developments:

* Integration with other communication tools: The Lan-Chat system will be developed to integrate with other popular communication tools such as email and instant messaging platforms.
* Mobile support: A mobile application will be developed to provide mobile support for Lan-Chat users.
* Multi-LAN support: The system will be developed to support communication across multiple LAN networks.

## Project Lifecycle:
The F-Society's Lan-Chat project can be developed and implemented using NetBeans IDE, which is a popular integrated development environment for Java programming language.

To implement the Lan-Chat project in NetBeans IDE, follow the steps below:

1. Install NetBeans IDE: Download and install the latest version of NetBeans IDE from the official website.

2. Create a new project: Launch NetBeans IDE and create a new project. Select "Java" as the category and "Java Application" as the project type. Click "Next" and give your project a name.

3. Design the user interface: The Lan-Chat user interface can be designed using Swing or JavaFX. Drag and drop the required components onto the form and customize them to fit the project's design.
 
4. Implement the backend logic: Write the Java code for the Lan-Chat's backend logic. This includes establishing connections between users within the same LAN network, implementing user authentication, encrypting messages and files, and implementing file sharing functionality.
 
5. Test the application: Test the application to ensure that it functions as expected. You can run the application in the NetBeans IDE's built-in testing environment.
 
6. Deploy the application: Once the application has been tested and validated, deploy it to the LAN network where it will be used. You may need to configure firewall settings to ensure that the application is accessible to users on the network.

> NetBeans IDE provides a range of tools and features that make it easy to develop and deploy complex Java applications like the Lan-Chat project. These include code debugging, version control integration, and a wide range of plugins and extensions. With NetBeans IDE, developers can develop and deploy high-quality applications quickly and efficiently.


> **Overall, the Lan-Chat project is a secure and reliable communication tool that provides users with an alternative to traditional communication tools that rely on the internet. It is designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and customizable, making it a great option for organizations and individuals who prioritize security and privacy in their communication.**
